- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @omf-tjdau TJ Dau
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in leaning programing languages.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use a resin printer and painting the minatures created.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he.him
- âš¡ Fun fact: My previous job was as a draftsmen to create blueprints for manufacturing. My favorite project was figuring out how to make the Stainless Steel screens at the new St. Louis Arch entrance. 6 months of figuring out how to take the Architeture vision and make it a reality!
